# Responsive CSS In-Class Exercise

Now that you've learned how to use media rule blocks to create responsive pages, let's practice those skills. Build a simple HTML page and accompanying CSS stylesheet that has the following:

- A `<header>` that has a cool background image on screens `768` pixels and wider, but only a solid background color on screens less than that width.
- Some other content (like a `<p>` element) that displays on screens `768` pixels and wider, but disappears on screens smaller than that.
- A responsive [flexbox grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) with 6 columns, each containing some content. You can use `lorem + Tab` to add lorem ipsum text, or use one of these [fun alternative generators](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/79940998-15-funny-lorem-ipsum-generators-to-shake-up-your-design-mockups). 
	- The columns should all be 100% wide and stack on top of each other by default
	- But then switch to a 2x3 layout on screens `490` pixels and wider
	- And switch to a 3x2 layout on screens `768` pixels and wider
	- And finally switch to a 1x6 layout (all columns sitting side-by-side on one line) on screens `1200` pixels and wider.
